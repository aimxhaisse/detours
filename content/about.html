Hi, I am Sébastien, a french photographer who started experimenting
with a film camera in 2013, to embark on a journey of self-processing
and printing in darkrooms.

<br /><br />

The person I bought my film camera from told me the most important
thing was to always have a spare roll in my pocket, an advice I have
been following for years now, snapshotting errands in Dublin streets,
Brittany fields, or deserted areas in the US.

<br /><br />

<b><a href="/">Détours</a></b> is an attempt at mixing my photographic
errands and projects with echoing words and music that I compose with
synthesizers when I'm not pushing films in my bathroom.
